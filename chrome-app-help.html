<br>
<p>To access your chrome apps on a mac or pc, type "chrome://apps" in your address bar.<br><br>

To create a desktop shortcut, open a new chrome tab and go to "chrome://apps". Right click on your chrome app, select "Create shortcuts..." then "Create."<br><br>

To force update your chrome apps and extensions, go to “chrome://extensions”, enable "Developer mode" (top right), then click "Update extensions now" (top right). We recommend turning off developer mode once you’re done.<br><br>

To chromecast a chrome app, you have to cast your entire desktop. Go to your chrome browser settings, click cast, then under the drop down "Cast to" menu on the top left, select "Cast desktop." Now simply open your chrome app and go to fullscreen.<br><br>
